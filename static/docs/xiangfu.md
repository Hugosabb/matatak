Xiangfu is a Xiangqi variant created by Eventlesstew for the Variant Design Contest.
This essentially aims to be, or was initially going to be, a spiritual successor to Chennis. This variant combines the upfrontness of Marial Arts with the careful aggression of Xiangqi. This is achieved through the Kings always being in the centre and the use of ranging pieces, including the Bishop and the Crossbow.

## Rules

- Pieces you capture can be dropped within the first two ranks of the board.
- The palaces on the opposing ends of the board are now combined into a single, large ring, where the Kings are confined to.
- Since each player has two champions, check and checkmate rules now work like in Spartan Chess. This means that if you have two champions, they can be used on the offensive. You must capture one champion in order to checkmate the other champion, unless you can perform a Duple Checkmate!

## Pieces

### Champion/King (K)
The champions move 1 space in any direction, like the king in Chess. They are the only pieces confined to the Ring.

### Pupil/Commoner (G)
The pupil moves 1 space in any direction, like the king in Chess. Pupil is the unpromoted, non royal version of the champion. When you take an opponent champion it will go to your hand as pupil.

### Horse (N)
The same as the horse in Xiangqi.

### Chariot (R)
The same as the chariot in Xiangqi.

### Cannon (C)
The same as the cannon in Xiangqi.

### Mahout/Elephant rider (M)
The Mahout moves two spaces in any direction.

### Bishop (B)
The same as the bishop in Chess.

### Crossbow (W)
A diagonal variant of the cannon, The crossbow moves any number of steps diagonally, but must jump over a piece in order to capture.
